**Greetings! I am an Assistant Professor at [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/).**
I am also affiliated with [Stevens Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SIAI)](https://www.stevens.edu/stevens-institute-for-artificial-intelligence) and the [Center for Research Toward Advancing Financial Technologies (CRAFT)](https://www.stevens.edu/craft).

<!-- I'm actively looking for Ph.D. students to work with me in AI-driven business analytics. Feel free to shoot me an email with your CV. Once we have a commitment to each other, I will exert my utmost effort to help you! -->

I'm looking for highly motivated, hard-working Ph.D. students as well as RAs to work with me in data science and interdisciplinary trustworthy GenAI. Feel free to shoot me an email with your CV. Once we have a commitment to each other, I will exert my utmost effort to help you!

To [prospective students](https://hackmd.io/@Fg51OpMIRxuG47UeqMhuZw/Hylyc7jSkg).

I received my Ph.D. from [Rutgers University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University#Rankings) recently where I was fortunate to work with Dr. [Hui Xiong](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=cVDF1tkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). 
<!-- I was a visiting scholar at UIUC, Siebel School of Computing and Data Science, in 2024, hosted by Prof. [Heng Ji](https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html). -->

<!-- My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning, natural langauge processing and business intelligence.  -->
<!-- More recently, I study the interplay between **LLMs/GenAI, legal and socioethical issue, business and innovation**. -->

<!-- More recently, I study the interaction between **LLM, business, law/ethics, social impact and innovation.** -->

<!-- I am interested in two types of research philosophy: (i) empower AI models with human domain knowledge, i.e., leverage domain knowledge to design new AI models for domain sciences (e.g., Talent Analytics and FinTech); (ii) leverage AI to discover new knowledge, i.e., apply machine learning to interpret societal phenomena and derive managerial implications to guide decision-making. -->

<!-- Specifically, my research focuses on **domain knowledge inspired deep representation learning** to fuse diverse knowledge sources (e.g., graph-structured knowledge, text semantic, and formula knowledge, etc) for complex domain adaptation.
My work is primarily related to the following topics,
-  **ML Methodologies:** Graph Representation Learning, Text Representation Learning, Reinforcement Learning.  
-  **Domain Applications:** Career Network Analysis, Employee Turnover Prediction, Venture Capital Portfolio Generation, E-commerce Product Linkage.  -->


My work has been published in top venues of machine learning, artificial intelligence and information systems, including refereed journals (**IEEE TKDE, IEEE BigData**) and conference proceedings (**NeruIPS, KDD, EMNLP, AAAI, IJCAI, SIGIR, ICDM, CIKM, CIST**, etc.). Some of my working papers are under review at **UTD and FT50 journals**.
